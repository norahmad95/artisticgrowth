who to be growth mindset 
## artistic growth mindset ##

** being growth minset depends on the words that you say it to your mind, if its positive it will grow as they say what you seed what you reap **

## how to be groth mindeset ?
    - challenges its a great thing you must thing about it as a new knowledge and experience that will be added to you 
    - effort, we all know that is not easy to do but if you keep remamber that its temporary you will escape it.
    - criticism its something acceptble because is the thing that show you other ways to do things or to thing about it.
    others success is somthing you should be inspired by, learne from, and add to it as they say energy transform fro one to another.

### my opinion 
the _ differnt _ btween groth and fixed mindset that the fixed ignores challenges and cariticism, they see a nigative things in evrey things they see others success come by luck not by doing effort.
